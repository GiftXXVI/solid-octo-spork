					<h2>The Current Situation?</h2>
					<h3>Problems with Scheduling</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>
							In traditional project management, requirements have to be collected, documented and frozen
							early in the development process and it is almost impossible to change them after this.
							<ul>
								<li>As a result, the customer does not see a working product until late in the
									development process.</li>
								<li>In addition, this process is slow in accomodating changing business requirements.
								</li>
								<li>Finally, the system is not tested or validated by the users until late in the
									development process.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Problems in the Team</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Work is delegated by the project manager to the team so they do not get the opportunity to
							discuss the work, schedule it and allocate it among themselves.</li>
						<li>The development team is split into 2 distinct groups handling complex tasks (in India) and
							simpler tasks (in the US).</li>
						<ul>
							<li>There is no transfer of knowledge between the two so capabilities are not being improved
								over time.</li>
							<li>There is no established coding standard making it difficult for the team to work
								together or pick up each other's work.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>

					<h2>The Solution?</h2>
					<h3>A New Framework.</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li><span class="text-left">WorldVizits needs a framework that will:</span></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Actively engage business users in the development process.</li>
							<li>Empower the development team to collaborate effectively and organize their work process.
							</li>
							<li>Prioritize the early, continuous and frequent delivery of business value.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>WorldVizits needs <b>an agile methodology</b>.</li>
					</ul>

					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is an Agile Methodology?</h3>
					<p class="small text-left">Agile methodologies are based on the Agile Manifesto.
						They have increased focus on:
					<ol class="small">
						<li>Engagement with business users. </li>
						<li>Delivery of business value.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is the Agile Manifesto?</h3>
					<span class="small">In 2001, a group of software developers met to find common
						ground among their
						methodologies. This common ground
						became the <b>Agile Manifesto</b>. The Manifesto says they value:</span></p>
					<table class="table table-bordered table-sm small">
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Individuals and interactions</td>
								<td rowspan="4" class="align-middle"><span
										class="font-weight-bold display-5">Over</span></td>
								<td>processes and tools</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Working software</td>
								<td>
									comprehensive documentation.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Customer collaboration</td>
								<td>
									contract negotiation.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Responding to change</td>
								<td>
									following a plan.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why we should follow the Manifesto</h3>
					<p class="small">
					<ul>
						<li>It recognises that:</li>

						<ul class="small">
							<li><b>People</b> build software with their domain knowledge and technical skills.
							</li>
							<li><b>Working software</b> brings the most business value of all project
								deliverables.</li>
							<li><b>Requirements are bound to change over time</b> and as our understanding improves.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Having the right priorities leads to consistent, predictable and
							repeatable success.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Long Before Agile, There was Waterfall</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>
							In the waterfall methodology, requirements are collected from customers, stakeholders and
							users at the beginning of a project and a fixed linear sequential schedule of phases is
							followed to design, create, test and deploy the product.
						</li>

					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The problems with Waterfall</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Once requirements are established, they become a contract between the developer(s) and the
							customer and it is almost impossible to change them.</li>
						<li>The output of each phase is a milestone that terminates the current phase and serves as the
							(required) initial input to the next phase. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								At the end of each phase, the milestone(or deliverable) is reviewed.
							</li>
							<li>If a milestone is approved, the work of the phase is
								not redone. Even if requirements change.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How Agile Fixes Waterfall's Problems</h3>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>In contrast Agile allows and anticipates changes in requirements at any point in the
							development process.</li>
						<li>Agile also includes Business Users in the developement team and encourages collaboration
							and constant communication thus feedback is immediate.</li>
						<li>Agile is incremental and iterative by design so there are many reviews to learn from and
							there are many opportunities to adapt the system to fit the new requirements in future
							iterations.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>When to use Waterfall (and Agile)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Waterfall works well when both the customer's requirements and technology for implementation
							are
							well known.</li>
						<li>Agile is recommended if either:
							<ul>
								<li>the requirements are not well understood</li> or
								<li>the technology is not well known</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If both requirements and technology are unclear, first clarify at least one.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How will WorldVisitz benefit from Agile?</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>
							Agile uses iterations to deliver small increments of the whole application, learning from
							the feedback of previous increments to make future increments and improve previous
							increments</li>
						<li> This ensures that at least part of
							the application is delivered early and that the customer starts seeing the system and
							receiving business value from it early.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>The Optimal Agile Framework</h3>
					<p>
						We have the following frameworks to choose from:
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Scrum</li>
						<li>Kanban</li>
						<li>Extreme Programming (XP)</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scrum works well when requirements are unknown and you need a process of continuous learning
							and adaptation that delivers business value early and frequently. </li>
						<li>Kanban works well when eliminating waste and optimizing a system.</li>
						<li>The best option is a combination of Scrum and Kanban. Scrum will enable delivery of value,
							Kanban will reduce waste, build in quality and empower the team.</li>
					</ul>
