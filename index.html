					<h2>Problems with Scheduling</h2>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>
							In traditional project management, requirements have to be collected, documented and frozen
							early in the development process and it is almost impossible to change them after this.
							<ul>
								<li>As a result, the customer does not see a working product until late in the development process.</li>
								<li>In addition, this process is slow in accomodating changing business requirements.</li>
								<li>Finally, the system is not tested or validated by the users until late in the development process.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Problems with the Team</h2>
					<ul class="small">
						<li>Work is delegated by the project manager to the team so they do not get the opportunity to
							discuss the work, schedule it and allocate it among themselves.</li>
						<li>The development team is split into 2 distinct groups handling complex tasks (in India) and
							simpler tasks (in the US).</li>
						<ul>
							<li>There is no transfer of knowledge between the two so capabilities are not being improved
								over time.</li>
							<li>There is no established coding standard making it difficult for the team to work
								together or pick up each other's work.</li>
						</ul>
